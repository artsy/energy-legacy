This is a core [Artsy Mobile](https://github.com/artsy/mobile) OSS project, along with [Eigen](https://github.com/artsy/eigen), [Eidolon](https://github.com/artsy/eidolon), [Emission](https://github.com/artsy/emission) and [Emergence](https://github.com/artsy/emergence).

Don't know what Artsy is? [Check this](https://github.com/artsy/mobile/blob/main/what_is_artsy.md) overview, or read our objc.io on [team culture](https://www.objc.io/issues/22-scale/artsy/).

Want to know more about Eigen? Read the [mobile](http://artsy.github.io/blog/categories/mobile/) blog posts, or [energy's](http://artsy.github.io/blog/categories/energy/) specifically. There's some great overview videos that cover almost all of the code-base.

### Docs

Get setup [here](docs/getting_started.md). Further documentation can be found in the [documentation folder](docs#readme) and in [the OSS announcement](http://artsy.github.io/blog/2015/08/06/open-sourcing-energy/).

Folio specific [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/95qNlO03/partner-success-revenue-near-term-roadmap) - you can use "Filter Cards" to just show Folio.

### Quick Start

Want to get the app running as an OSS project? Run this in your shell:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/artsy/energy.git
cd energy
# For OSS folks
make oss
# For Artsy folks
make artsy
open "Artsy Folio.xcworkspace"
```

You will have a running version of the Artsy app by hitting `Build > Run`.

### Work at Artsy?

- Run tests on an `iPad Air 2` running `11.2`.

### Troubleshooting

If you are seeing `bundle: command not found` when running the OSS Quick Start commands, you will need to install [bundler](http://bundler.io). You can do this by writing `sudo gem install bundler`.
